# Restaurant-Togashi-Ramen

## Description

This React JS project simulates a website for an Asian restaurant specializing in ramen. It displays a variety of dishes with detailed descriptions of their ingredients, highlighting if they contain spicy elements or if they are suitable for vegetarians or vegans. Upon selecting a dish, dessert, and refreshments, the site offers the option to dine in the restaurant, pick up the order, or request a home delivery service. It even allows adding or removing products before order confirmation. The website also provides simulated contact information, schedules, location, social media links, and a gallery of kitchen images.

## API Usage

The application uses an API built with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL to obtain the data it needs. The API provides endpoints to access the data of the ramen dishes, desserts, and drinks offered by the restaurant. Visitors to the web application can view the different ramen dishes, desserts, and drinks available on the restaurantâ€™s menu.

The API is hosted on Vercel and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. The address of the API is https://togashi-api.vercel.app/.

The application makes HTTP requests to the following API endpoints:

/ramen: Returns a list of all available ramen dishes.
